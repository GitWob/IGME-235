# Hello world!

My name's William and I'm a second-year GDD student from Kansas. I used to only code with Python and Unreal Engine Blueprints but now I mostly use C#, and I'm trying to learn HLSL (it's hard). I also like to write songs and play instruments. I'm also into games, which is cool because I think we all have that in common.
Favorite PC games: Spore, Quadrilateral Cowboy, The Beginner's Guide, and Garry's Mod
Favorite console games: LittleBigPlanet and Wipeout.
Favorite web games: Iron Snout and THE CLUB by Crows Crows Crows
